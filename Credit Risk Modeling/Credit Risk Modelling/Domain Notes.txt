Credit risk modelling by Rohan Azad (AVP Data Scientist - BOB)

Problem Statement :
We have a bank customer database and we are trying to predict whether to give a loan or not.

Banking Terms:

- Assert = Loan Product (All kind of loans provided by the bank as it generates income for the bank) 
Credit card

- Liability (Bank paying money out of their pocket such as interest to customers)
Current Account
Savings Account
Together termed as CASA

FIxed Deposit (FD)
Recurring Deposit (RD)
Together termed as Term Deposits (TD)


# Something which is an asset for the bank is Liability for the Customer and Liability for the bank is generally asset for the customer.

NPA = Non Performing Asset
- Loan that is defaulted is categorized as NPA 

1. Disbursed Amount = Loan amount given to a customer
2. OSP = Out Standing Principle 
For Example : Bank has lend a loan amount of 1 lakh rupees  to a borrower, with monthly EMI 5000 . The borrower has paid 15 installments till date that is 75k. So the remaining amount that is still to be paid to the bank is 25k which is the Out Standing Principle on this loan.  
OSP should be zero at the end of the loan cycle.

3. EMI  = Principle amount + Interest (Whenever a emi gets paid only the principle amount gets deducted from the loan amount and interest amount goes to bank. This is called Amortization*)

4. DPD = Days past Due (Payment made after n days  from due date)
Ideally DPD should be 0
if DPD >0 then customer is defaulted the payment or skip the payment.

5. PAR = Portfolio at Risk (OSP when DPD > 0)

6. NPA =  Loan account when DPD > 90

# Credit Risk Types in Banking (Every credit Risk is based on DPD)
- DPD = 0 : NDA (Non Delinquint account) 
- DPD (0 to 30) : SMA1 (Standard Monitoring Account)
- DPD (31 to 60) : SMA2 (Standard Monitoring Account)
- DPD (61 to 90) : SMA3 (Standard Monitoring Account)
- DPD (90 to 180) : NPA
- DPD > 180 : Written-off (Loan which is not present) 

Why write-offs ?
- Helps to improve NPA figure = Loan portfolio quality of the bank will be better = Market sentiment will be good = Stock price will improve

NPA has two types : 
- GNPA = Gross Non Perfoming Assets = defaulted last 3-5 % OSP 
- NNPA = Net Non Perfoming Assets = defaulted last 0.01-0.06% OSP = BUt bank takes care of it as in every financial year is carries a provisioning amount for safe side and it substracts the remaining small from it.(Only for the NNPA as it is very small) 

To access a bank quality always check its GNPA . It will tell us how good is the decision making of the bank.

CIBIL is the central entity in india which recieves loan details from every bank and after analysing it gives a credit score AKA CIBIL score.  
CIBIL score = credit score (350 to 900) = Higher score means you have better payback history


*Loan in technical terms when entered in the bank system is known as Tradeline (TL)

* Bank lends money to people who dont need money


Question to Business user

P1 : Best
P2 : Second Best
P3 : Third Best
P4 : Last

Ask the business user to give their risk appetite. [That is how much they are willing to sell loans]

if low that means their targets already has achieved . You can suggest to focus on P1. 
if high That means their Targets are far away . You can suggest focusing on P1, P2 and P3
if Severe risk appetite then the target is very very far away then you can suggest to focus on P1, P2, P3 and P4

WHat is the business interpretation here?

P1 and P2 helps to reduce risk
whereas P3 and P4 helps to reach targets


============================================================================

Feedback loop

Once you deploy the model and the business end user uses it . They will give you feedback that for example the person you classified as P3 is actually P1 and more such case.

Now after reaciving the feeback we will re-label the rows and retrain the model with the updated information.

* Model should be evolving with time.



Methods for hyper parameter Tuning:
1. Grid Search     ---- Checks for all the combination
2. Random Search   ---- randomly selects combination
3. Bayesian Optimization   ----- If a parameter causes decrease in performance the algorithm automatically exclude it from future test combinations. {Imp for interview}
